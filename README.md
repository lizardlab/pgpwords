# PGPWords
Small scripts which encode PGP fingerprints into verifiable words. It has an executable JAR file for point and click use. There is also an HTML page that has a script embedded within it which does the same function, which is the recommended way to use it. Feel free to use it with any other cryptographic fingerprint, it just needs to be hexadecimal.
* pgpwords.html: web page for fingerprint encoding **(recommended)**
* PGPWordList.java: source code for command line encoder
* PGPWords.java: source code for GUI fingerprint encoder
* PGPWords.jar: executable for GUI fingerprint encoder
